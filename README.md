# Elytra Only Cape Option Mod
Fabric 1.21
***
Elytra Only Cape Option is a client-side mod that adds the option to
display the cape only when Elytra is equipped.

This mod is useful for players who want to have a custom skin for the Elytra,
but do not want the cape to be displayed without it.

This option is enabled in the skin customization menu.
